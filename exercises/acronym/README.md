# Acronym

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name
like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Groovy resources page](https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/resources).

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Groovy to install the necessary
dependencies:

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```sh
$ gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
