[Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/), initially released in 2007, is a dynamic object-oriented programming language based on Java.

Groovy offers flexible and loosely typed syntax compared to Java, but still compiles down to [Java Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) (JVM) [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) and is fully interoperable with existing Java programs and libraries. 

Some of Groovy's features include:
  1. String interpolation, allowing static strings to include references to dynamic variables through the use of GStrings.
  2. Closures, allowing code to be written a ran at a different time.
  3. Flexible syntax, with semicolons, dots, and parentheses being optional in many cases.
  4. Built in XML & JSON parsing.
  5. [Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming).

Groovy can also be used as a scripting language, similar to Python, allowing Groovy code to be executed without the need to be precompiled to class files first.

While it can be used with any existing Java framework, the [Grails Framework](https://grails.org/) provides an alternative methodology for writing JVM based web applications in Groovy.
