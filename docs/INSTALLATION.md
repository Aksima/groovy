### Installation

#### Installing Java

In order to work with Groovy, you will also need Java. The instructions for setting up Java can be found on [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html), but you may also want to look at the installation instructions found on the [Java Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/java) page

#### Installing Groovy

Detailed installation instructions for Groovy can be found at [http://www.groovy-lang.org/install.html](http://www.groovy-lang.org/install.html).

#### Install an IDE

It is recommended to use an IDE for working with your Groovy exercises. It will provide code assistance, automatic compilation, and a GUI for running the tests. 

The community version of IntelliJ IDEA offers all the tooling you will need. Download and installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
